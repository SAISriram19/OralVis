1. Dataset Overview 
You will receive a dataset of ~500 dental panoramic images with corresponding YOLO
format annotations. Each image has a .txt file containing bounding boxes for teeth using the 
FDI numbering system. 
YOLO Label Format: class_id center_x center_y width height (all normalized between 0 and 
1). 
2. FDI Tooth Numbering System 
The FDI system is the international standard for dental numbering. It uses two digits: - First digit = Quadrant (1=upper right, 2=upper left, 3=lower left, 4=lower right) - Second digit = Tooth position within quadrant (1=central incisor → 8=third molar) 
 
Examples: 
• 11 = Upper Right Central Incisor 
• 36 = Lower Left First Molar 
• 48 = Lower Right Third Molar

4. Dataset Preparation 
You will receive ~500 dental panoramic images with YOLO-format labels (FDI tooth 
numbering). 
Steps: 
• Split the dataset into Train (80%), Validation (10%), and Test (10%). 
• Ensure images and labels are paired correctly. 
 
5. Data Configuration 
Create a data.yaml file with paths to train/val/test and include the 32 FDI classes. 
Example: 
 
train: path/to/train/images 
val: path/to/val/images 
test: path/to/test/images 
names: 
  0: Canine (13) 
  1: Canine (23) 
  ... 
  31: Third Molar (48) 
 
*Class order must not be changed.
6. Model Training 
• Train any YOLO variant (YOLOv5/YOLOv8/YOLOv11). 
• Recommended input size: 640x640. 
• Use pretrained weights (e.g., yolov8s.pt). 
• Save your training logs, weights, and metrics. 
7. Model Evaluation 
• Evaluate on the validation/test sets. 
• Submit: - Confusion Matrix (per class). - Performance metrics: Precision, Recall, mAP@50, mAP@50-95. - Sample prediction images showing bounding boxes + FDI IDs. - include training curves (loss/accuracy plots)
 8. Post-Processing (Optional but Recommended) 
Apply logic to improve anatomical correctness: 
• Separate upper vs lower arch (Y-axis clustering). 
• Divide left vs right quadrants (X-midline). 
• Sort teeth horizontally within quadrants and assign FDI sequentially. 
• Handle missing teeth by skipping numbers where spacing is wide.
